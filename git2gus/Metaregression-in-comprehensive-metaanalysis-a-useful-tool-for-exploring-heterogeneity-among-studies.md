# Meta-regression in comprehensive meta-analysis: a useful tool for exploring heterogeneity among studies
 
Meta-regression is a statistical technique that allows the examination of the relationship between one or more covariates and the effect size of interest in a meta-analysis. Meta-regression can help to explain the sources of heterogeneity among studies, which may be due to differences in study characteristics, such as population, intervention, outcome, or methodological quality. Meta-regression can also test for potential moderators or mediators of the effect size, such as dose-response, duration of treatment, or subgroup effects.

Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) is a software program that facilitates the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses. CMA provides various options for performing meta-regression, such as fixed-effects or random-effects models, categorical or continuous covariates, and univariate or multivariate analyses. CMA also produces graphical displays of the meta-regression results, such as forest plots, funnel plots, scatter plots, and bubble plots. CMA can handle different types of effect sizes, such as standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, correlation coefficient, or Hedges' g.
 
In this article, we provide an overview of the principles and applications of meta-regression in CMA. We illustrate the use of meta-regression with an example from a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of systemic therapy for advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma[^2^]. We also discuss the advantages and limitations of meta-regression in CMA and provide some practical recommendations for conducting and interpreting meta-regression analyses.

Meta-regression in CMA is performed by selecting the "Meta-regression" option from the "Analysis" menu. The user can then choose the covariates to include in the meta-regression model, either from the predefined list of study characteristics or by entering custom variables. The user can also specify the type of model (fixed-effects or random-effects), the type of covariate (categorical or continuous), and the number of decimal places for the output. CMA will then display the results of the meta-regression in a table and a graph.
 
The table shows the regression coefficient, standard error, 95% confidence interval, p-value, and R-squared for each covariate. The regression coefficient indicates the direction and magnitude of the relationship between the covariate and the effect size. A positive coefficient means that the effect size increases with the covariate, while a negative coefficient means that the effect size decreases with the covariate. The standard error and confidence interval reflect the precision and uncertainty of the estimate. The p-value tests the null hypothesis that the coefficient is zero, meaning that there is no relationship between the covariate and the effect size. The R-squared measures the proportion of variance in the effect size that is explained by the covariate.
 
The graph shows a scatter plot of the effect size versus the covariate, with a regression line fitted to the data. The graph also shows a bubble plot of the effect size versus the covariate, with each bubble representing a study and its size proportional to its weight in the meta-analysis. The graph can help to visualize the pattern and strength of the relationship between the covariate and the effect size, as well as to identify any outliers or influential studies.
